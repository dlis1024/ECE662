    "# Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning, neural networks have modified and learned a set of parameters to perform our classification task. However, such parameters are costly to maintain and do not hold the same importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be great could optimize our resource usage by dropping less important values ? This is where pruning comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is a technique that cuts off parameters/structures from a model to increase sparcity and decrease overall model size, similar to cutting leafs or branches from bushes and trees. This process can lead to smaller memory consumption with minimal accuracy reduction. Moreover, pruning the network may also provide a speedup since there will be less operations being performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pruning process can be performed during the end of an epoch of training or after training is complete. Experimenting to find out which way works the best is part of the fun !"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

On the other hand, dropout temporarily turns off random neurons during training to help prevent overfitting. Both techniques would be beneficial to developing a neural network as we prune to make the model smaller and faster and use dropout randomly to prevent overfitting.]\n"
