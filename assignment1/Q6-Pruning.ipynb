    "# Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning, neural networks have modified and learned a set of parameters to perform our classification task. However, such parameters are costly to maintain and do not hold the same importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be great could optimize our resource usage by dropping less important values ? This is where pruning comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is a technique that cuts off parameters/structures from a model to increase sparcity and decrease overall model size, similar to cutting leafs or branches from bushes and trees. This process can lead to smaller memory consumption with minimal accuracy reduction. Moreover, pruning the network may also provide a speedup since there will be less operations being performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pruning process can be performed during the end of an epoch of training or after training is complete. Experimenting to find out which way works the best is part of the fun !"

However, some of these changes may affect output dimensions which may be carried over to other parts of the network.
